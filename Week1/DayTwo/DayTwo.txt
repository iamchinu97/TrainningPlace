	-if array size is not specified default size is 10
	-should have copy constructors
	-should read the elements
	-method should sort array

--HomeWork---
1. resource bundling, log4j, lamda expressions, method referencec, Streams, Filters, Mapping, Statistical information
2. inbuilt functional interfaces

----Notes---
How to change Compilation env?
Ans : right click on project-->Build path --> configure build path --> Libraries --> double click on JRE --> then you can change 

@Encapsulation :
can be implemented
--through access modifiers
--through packages

#Access Modifiers(they have class level accessiblity can't write in function)
private- only accessible into class
default- accessible inside package
protected- accesible inside package and outside package through inheritance, can't use through instance if we instantiate in Inherited class but can use inside function of inherited class directly. 
public- Accessible to all

@Polymorphism
can have 2 types
